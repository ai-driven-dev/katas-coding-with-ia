# Architecture Overview - IA tips

This file has been generated by an AI using the `project_structure.txt` file.
It can be easily updated with an IDE that has the codebase indexed using Cody or with Cursor.sh for example. Develop and request a refresh of the bottom section as needed.

## Architectural Patterns

- Clean Architecture
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Dependency Injection
- Repository Pattern ()

## Key Components

1. **Core**: Contains application configurations and decoration of the application life cycle.
2. **Features**: Implements specific features of the application.
3. **Infrastructures**: Handles data persistence and external services.

## Design Principles

- Separation of Concerns
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- PostgreSQL
- xUnit for testing

## API Endpoints

- `/WeatherForecast`: Provides weather forecast data
- `/Trains`: Manages train-related operations

## Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- HTTP Tests using WebApplicationFactory

## Deployment

- Docker support for containerization
- CI/CD pipeline (to be implemented)

## Future Considerations

- Implement authentication and authorization
- Add more features related to train management
- Enhance error handling and logging
- Implement caching for improved performance
